# HuffPress

## What's up?

Hey! This is a simple web-service called ![HuffPress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Huff-Press-orange.svg). What it does? Well, actually it _huffpresses_ files... I mean, compresses files using the [Huffman compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding 'Read about it on Wikipedia').

## What do I need?

- Any web browser
- ![PHP 7+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7+-blueviolet.svg)
- ![Python 3.7+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3+-blue.svg)
- `click` library

## So, how do I use it?

I think it's too easy to explain the usage of this service, but anyway here's [a video guide](https://yadi.sk/i/aiy78bDaoKqoJQ 'Watch!').
