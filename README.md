# HuffPress

## What's up?

Hey! This is a simple web-service called __HuffPress__. What it does? Well, actually it _huffpresses_ files... I mean, compresses files using the [Huffman compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding 'Read about it on Wikipedia').

Also it uses a bit modified [SHICHIRO coding](https://github.com/H1K0/SHICHIRO 'View on GitHub') for compressing and embedding Huffman table.

## What do I need?

- Any web browser
- ![PHP 7+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7+-blueviolet.svg)
- ![Python 3.7+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3+-blue.svg)
- `click` python library

## So, how do I use it?

I think the usage is too easy to explain it, but anyway here's [a video guide](https://yadi.sk/i/aiy78bDaoKqoJQ 'Watch!').
